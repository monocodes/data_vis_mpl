### 15-4. Modified Random Walks ###
"""
In the RandomWalk class, x_step and y_step are generated from the same set of conditions. The direction is chosen randomly from the list [1, -1] and the distance from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Modify the values in these lists to see what happens to the overall shape of your walks. Try a longer list of choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the â€“1 from the x or y direction list.
